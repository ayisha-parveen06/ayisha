How It's work 

1. Data Collection
AI systems gather data from various sources: medical records, lab results, imaging (X-rays, MRIs), genetic information, and patient history.

2. Data Processing and Analysis
Machine Learning (ML) models are trained on large datasets of medical information.

3. Diagnosis Support
AI algorithms can:Detect anomalies in imaging scans (e.g., cancer, fractures).

4. Treatment Planning
AI helps design personalized treatment plans:Predicts patient responses to medications.

5. Monitoring and Follow-up
AI-driven applications can monitor patient progress and detect early signs of complications.Real-time alerts can be sent to healthcare providers if abnormal patterns are detected.

6. Robotic Surgery and Automation
AI is used in robotic-assisted surgeries to enhance precision and reduce human error.Automation in hospitals (e.g., automated medication dispensing, virtual nurse assistants) improves efficiency.

Real-World Applications
IBM Watson Health: Assists in cancer diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

Google DeepMind: Analyzes eye scans for early detection of diseases.

PathAI: Helps pathologists diagnose cancer faster and more accurately
